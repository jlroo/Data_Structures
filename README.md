DATA STRUCTURES
COMP 271
Thursday 6:00 PM - 9:30PM
Crown Center 105
Professor: Ms. Maria Saenz

This course is a continuation of COMP 170 introduces the concepts of data abstraction and data structure, 
including stacks, queues, lists, sets, and trees. The issues of implementing a data structure in a language such as C++ 
are examined using classes, arrays, and linked structures. Sorting and searching techniques are analyzed. 
The concepts of correctness and efficiency of algorithms are developed. Time/space comparisons of iterative algorithms 
with recursive algorithms are made. The course includes several major programming projects.
